        <h4>What is JourneyMonitor?</h4>
        <p>
            JourneyMonitor keeps an eye on your website using Selenium.
            Simply install <a target="_blank" href="http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/2.9.0/selenium-ide-2.9.0.xpi">the Selenium IDE plugin for Firefox</a>
            and record important user journeys on your site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, upload the resulting <em>Selenese</em> HTML code to JourneyMonitor. We will regularly execute your scripts
            in a real Firefox browser. If a test run fails, we send you an e-mail with the details.
        </p>

        <h4>What is JourneyMonitor NOT?</h4>
        <p>
            JourneyMonitor is not meant to be integrated into your Continuous Integration workflow. There are better alternatives for this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, we fill the gap between watching your site with simple HTTP checks (think Pingdom) and your regression-tests in your CI workflow.
            We watch for regressions <em>continuously</em>, so you know when things break even if you are not currently integrating.
